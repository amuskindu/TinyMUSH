   bitwise or: `DP_ONOLCK', which means it opens a database file without file locking, or
   `DP_OLCKNB', which means locking is performed without blocking.  `DP_OCREAT' can be added to
   by bitwise or: `DP_OSPARSE', which means it creates a database file as a sparse file.
   `bnum' specifies the number of elements of the bucket array.  If it is not more than 0,
   the default value is specified.  The size of a bucket array is determined on creating,
   and can not be changed except for by optimization of the database.  Suggested size of a

   The size of alignment is suggested to be average size of the values of the records to be

   default value is specified.  The number of division can not be changed from the initial value.
